# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Am working on a dataset from kaggle to predict the quality of wine having several features such as fixed acidity,volatile acidity,density........,The quality as two classifications(5 and 6)
This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks but I chose  to make predictions based on a decision tree model and got an accuraccy of 0.502
